Marking the end of an era, Cydia — the App Store for jailbroken devices — has been shut down. Cydia’s creator Saurik made this announcement on Reddit after a bug was discovered in the platform that may have put user data at risk.

(UPDATE: This post was updated to clarify that this will only affect themes/tweaks that require credit/debit/PayPal purchases. Free tweaks were NOT affected.)
